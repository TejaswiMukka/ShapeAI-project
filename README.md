# Weather_Update
 This code uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather data of a city entered by the user. 
 The API key and city name are taken as input from the user, and then the API link is generated using these values.

The API response is stored in the variable api_data, which is a JSON object. 
The code then extracts the required information from this JSON object, such as temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and date and time.

Finally, the extracted information is printed in a user-friendly format using the print statements.

Overall, this code provides a simple way to get the current weather information of any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
